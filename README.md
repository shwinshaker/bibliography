## Machine Learning
* Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers
    - Discriminative classifiers (Eg. Logistic; SVM) learn the decision boundary ($P(y|x)$); Generative classifiers (Eg. Naive bayes; HMM) model the distribution.($P(x,y)$ -> $P(y|x)$) ([Nice story](https://medium.com/@mlengineer/generative-and-discriminative-models-af5637a66a3))
    - Discriminative and Generative learners specialize in distinct regimes. ([Nice paper By Andrew Ng](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf))
